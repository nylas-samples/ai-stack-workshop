The repository will show you how to get started with building using the AI Stack and Email. To get up to speed, we will keep this workshop light with respect to dependencies and third party services. 

We will need some data to work with, so will use our emails retrieved using the Nylas Email API. To learn more about Nylas, check out our developer docs.
